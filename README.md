# QMK ARDUX Implementation for the rp2040 - Zero

It's just a fork of the main one made by @granitrocky on Discord. I had to rename some pins in order to solder it better on the RP2040-Zero. Other than that, it's basically the same.

## Inspiraion

A lot of this work wouldn't be possible with outside inspiration. In no particular order:

- The ARDUX community for their help ensuring our code is maximally accessible
- [filterpaper's QMK userspace](https://github.com/filterpaper/qmk_userspace)
- [sungo's QMK userspace](https://git.sr.ht/~sungo/qmk_userspace)
